Element is designed to be very simple and straightforward to use.

:elephant: Requirements
===
Element requires PHP 7.1+.

> **IMPORTANT:** If you want to use YAML files or strings, then you need to require in the [Symfony Yaml component](https://packagist.org/packages/symfony/yaml#v5.4.39) in your `composer.json`.

:zap: Installation
===
The supported way of creating an Element project is via Composer.

```sh
$ composer create-project element/nexus <NAME>
```

Whats the foss all about?
===
Element is designed to be very simple and straightforward to use. It's kind of similar to Laravel, but with a structure and context that suited my needs and
taste in a better way!... While the public views are more or less up to the developer itself, I decided to use the free version of [Soft UI Dashboard from creative tim](https://www.creative-tim.com/product/soft-ui-dashboard) for the backend dashboard, simply because it's really easy to use! It has lots of cool ui elements
and the best part of it?! It's 100% free - Even for commercial apps ðŸ˜Š So you are good there ðŸ‘Œ... Although it comes with an MIT license, so please bear that in mind whenever you make any changes to the code.

**But I highly recommend** any users of Element3 to check out their [Pro version](https://www.creative-tim.com/product/soft-ui-dashboard-pro) ðŸ‘€ðŸ“¢ It's really cool, and it comes with a lot of extra cool features... Or else feel free to switch to your own template if you like. (I left the theme as a .zip folder under 'src/assets/themes')

:speech_balloon: Usage
===
Open up the terminal and type the command below, to see a list of all the commands Element cli has to offer...
``` bash
$ php element
```

For example, this command will launch the app on the built-in webserver
``` bash
$ php element app:serve
```
But please try it out for yourself! :rocket: It has loads of cool features :sunglasses:

Testing
===
``` bash
$ phpunit
```
